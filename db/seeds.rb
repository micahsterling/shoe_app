# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# shoe = Shoe.new(brand: "micster", style: "toothy", color: "beam blue", size: "5-10", stock: "yes")
# shoe.save
# shoe = Shoe.new(brand: "micster", style: "bommer", color: "black blue", size: "5-10", stock: "yes")
# shoe.save
# shoe = Shoe.new(brand: "micster", style: "circle M", color: "Yellow", size: "5-10", stock: "yes")
